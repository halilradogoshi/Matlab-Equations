# Matlab - Quartic Equations

Solving quartic equations by using Matlab graphs. The project enables the user to input constants for any given quartic equation and presents the result as a graph. 

The user will have to input five constants (a,b,c,d,e) for the quartic equation:

**ax<sup>4</sup> + bx<sup>3</sup> + cx<sup>2</sup> + dx + e = 0**  

The result will then be shown in a graph.
